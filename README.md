## Awesomeness Criteria

1. Solves problem as above
2. Excepting utility functions, lines of code ~= lines of requirements. No reliance on indices.
3. Your Honour, I respectfully submit that there is strong circumstantial evidence of TDD in that a working solution was developed in a short time. Unfortunately the REPL history is lost to us. Hereto and furthermore I intend to present evidence of said TDD prior to trial. There can be no “I, Object” in this paradigm. I rest my case.
4. Please go follow the script above. Sorry, I’m really done now.
